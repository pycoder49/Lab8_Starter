Answer to the question:

Graceful degredation and the service workers are related in a sense that they both share the same goal. They both try and focus on making the web app more smooth and to give the user a smoother experience. Service workers accomplish this by storing things in cache so that the user can still do some things when offline (if not fully). Instead of just breaking down and crashing on the user with a big red warning that they might not understand, it makes sure that it degrades gracefully, allowing the user to continue in case network does go down.
